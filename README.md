# instagrambot
Instagram bot for seeing the accounts that you follow and they do not follow you back

First of all: you have to disable the Two Factor Authentification from your account. If this feature is enabled then this application will not work. I recommend using PyCharm for this project.

Follow the next steps for configuation:
1) Install selenium web browser from: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
2) Create a file inside your project named: not_followers.txt
3) Edit the secrets.py file using the instructions inside of it.

Hope that you enjoy this mini-project!
